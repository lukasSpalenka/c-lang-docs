## Description

The C library function **int remove(const char \*filename)** deletes the given **filename** so that it is no longer accessible.

## Declaration

Following is the declaration for remove() function.

```

## Example

The following example shows the usage of remove() function.

#include <string.h>

int main () {
   int ret;
   FILE *fp;
   char filename[] = "file.txt";

   fp = fopen(filename, "w");

   fprintf(fp, "%s", "This is tutorialspoint.com");
   fclose(fp);
   
   ret = remove(filename);

   if(ret == 0) {

}
```

Let us assume we have a text file **file.txt** having some content. So we are going to delete this file, using the above program. Let us compile and run the above program to produce the following message and the file will be deleted permanently.

```c

```
