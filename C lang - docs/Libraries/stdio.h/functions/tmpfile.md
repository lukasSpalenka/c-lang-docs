## Description

The C library function **FILE \*tmpfile(void)** creates a temporary file in binary update mode (wb+). The temporary file created is automatically deleted when the stream is closed (fclose) or when the program terminates.

## Declaration

Following is the declaration for tmpfile() function.

```c
FILE *tmpfile(void)
```

## Parameters

-   **NA**
    

## Return Value

If successful, the function returns a stream pointer to the temporary file created. If the file cannot be created, then NULL is returned.

## Example

The following example shows the usage of tmpfile() function.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
   FILE *fp;

   fp = tmpfile();
   printf("Temporary file created\n");

   /* you can use tmp file here */

   fclose(fp);

   return(0);
}
```

Let us compile and run the above program to create a temporary file in /tmp folder but once your program is out, it will be deleted automatically and the program will produce the following result âˆ’

```c
Temporary file created

```
